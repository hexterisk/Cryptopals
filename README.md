# Cryptopals
Solutions to the original Matasano challenges hosted by Cryptopals.

The repository has a scripted solution for each of the challenge in Python3. All the scripts import helper functions from [lib.py](https://github.com/hexterisk/cryptopals-solutions/blob/master/lib.py).
Explanations for the solution of each challenge can be found at the [blog](https://hexterisk.tech/blog/categories/cryptopals/).

iPython notebooks for each set have been included for a sequential run of a set, and quick variable/value checking and debugging.
